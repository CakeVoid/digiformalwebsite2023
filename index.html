                <p>Welcome to the Cashmere High School 2024 Formal website. The information on this site is intended
                    to
                    inform
                    you of the details on our upcoming senior formal happening in August, as well as providing you
                    with
                    an idea
                    of what to expect when you get there.
                    The information and images included on this site will not only show you how significant and
                    memorable this
                    event will be but will hopefully excite you into considering attending yourself. This is truly
                    one
                    of the
                    highlights of the senior school years, so make sure you don’t miss the opportunity to take part!

                    The cost of the event is $100 per ticket – this includes the cost of a photographer, venue hire,
                    decorations, supper and refreshments. Students will be able to pay for their tickets from 31 May
                    2024.
                    Physical tickets will be issued to students in the week prior to the event.
                    Students are advised that they must be inside the venue by 7.30pm. The doors will open at 7pm.
                    The
                    event
                    finishes at 11pm. Any students who leave the venue during the evening will not be readmitted.
                    Partners from outside of Cashmere High School are welcome to attend, however guest numbers are
                    limited
                    and require prior approval from the Head of School. Details of how to request this will be made
                    available on this website soon.
                    The school does not organise or have any association with ‘after parties’. These events can
                    diminish
                    the
                    focus and status of the main event. At this stage we are not aware of an after party being
                    organised
                    but
                    the possibility of one occurring is high. We wish to be up front with families about this, but
                    please
                    note we do not endorse these events, nor will we be assisting in the organisation of one.
                    Furthermore,
                    if there is any such event, the school cannot accept responsibility for this.
                    We trust that this evening will be another enjoyable and safe occasion.

                Attending the Senior Formal is a privilege, not a right. As in previous years there are limited
                tickets and a strict criteria applies to all students wishing to attend this event. The decision as
                to whether students will be able to attend is made by the Head of School and the Associate
                Principal, and is based upon the following criteria:

                <ul>
                    <li>Student account is debt free or an auto-payment has been set up with the Payment Centre
                        prior to the end of Term 2 2024, and the total debt owing is less than $200. However, if
                        financial hardship is a concern in terms of your child attending, please contact the Head of
                        School to discuss possible supports available.</li>
                    <li> Students have fewer than 10% unjustified absences at the end of Week 9 of Term 2.</li>
                    <li> Students have cleared all school detentions prior to the end of Week 9 Term 2.</li>
                </ul>
                The Senior Formal is a school event; therefore the usual rules apply regarding behaviour and banned
                substances, including vapes. As with all school functions for students there will be no alcohol at
                this
                event. Any student who brings alcohol or who arrives under the influence of alcohol will not be
                allowed
                to attend and may face school disciplinary action.
